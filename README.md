# GameEngine

In this project, I focused on creating an light weight API library for 2D games. 

Where you can create  animations, sprites, collisions, Players,parallax scrolling, as well as 2D platformer worlds. 

Of course this can still be improve futher.

In the future I want to add:

spaceships (worlds)
races      (worlds)
RPG        (worlds)
allow input from controllers
GUI for Menu
SAVING 

DumbWalking enemies  abstract
DumbFlying enemies   abstract
Boss       enemies   abstract
